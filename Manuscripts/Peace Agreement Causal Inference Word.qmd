# Introduction

# The Literature on Peace Agreements and Post-Conflict Peace

Overwhelmingly, research on how prior war outcomes effects post-conflict peace has determined that prior war outcomes do, in fact, correlate with post-conflict peace. However, what remains less clear is *what type(s)* of war outcomes matter for preserving post-conflict peace. Earlier findings in this literature suggested that military victories, in which one side of the war ends the conflict by a military defeat of the opponent, are likely to lead to a more peaceful post-conflict environment given that a military defeat results in one side being forced to disarm and demobilize, therefore, reducing the likelihood that the defeated party will have the capacity to challenge the victor once the prior conflict has ended (Wagner 1993). In this sense, wars that are terminated through other means, such as through peace agreements, simply prolong the true termination of war since both parties retain some military capacity to continue conflict when it benefits them, respectively (Luttwak 1999). Licklider (1995) found empirical support for this notion with important caveats. First, according to Licklider (1995) military victories negatively correlate with conflict recurrence *only if the prior conflict was an identity conflict*. Second, military victories were also found to correlate with acts of genocide, despite the "pacifying" effect of potentially reducing the chances of conflict recurrence. Downes (2004) provided a theoretical rationale for why negotiated settlements may be particularly unsuited to resolve *ethnic* conflicts, citing the potential for indivisible issues, the hardening of out-group hostilities, and the near-constant mobilizational capacity of ethnic groups as reasons for these difficulties. Other scholars have argued that further specification is needed to understand why military victories may lead to peace. For example, rebel military victories may lead to increased prospects of post-conflict peace (Toft 2010). After all, rebel organizations (and sentiment for rebel causes) can persist following a government military victory. Rebels have the capacity to temporarily refrain from armed conflict, with the intent of resuming armed conflict at a later point when their mobilizational and military capacity increases. Because of this, it may be expected that the peace generated from a government military victory may be more likely to break down than peace generated from a rebel victory (Quinn et al. 2007). Turning away from the study of *conflict recurrence*, recent work that considers the effect of peace agreements on alternative conceptualizations of post-conflict peace, such as military coups, has demonstrated findings that are not optimistic for proponents of peace agreements (White 2020).

On both theoretical and empirical grounds, the notion that peace agreements are ineffective and likely to break down has been challenged repeatedly. For example, Hartzell (2017) argued that interstate and intrastate conflicts may be so qualitatively different from each other that the application of the bargaining model of war used to theoretically justify the potentially pacifying effects of military victories may be invalid as actors and incentives between the two types of wars may not be interchangeable. Even within the context of the bargaining model of war, many scholars have argued that *the contents of a peace agreement matter* for explaining why certain peace agreements are successful while others are not. Such contents can be manipulated to resolve issues, such as private information and commitment problems, that may lead actors to renege on peace agreements and re-ignite violence (Mattes and Savun 2009, 2010, Joshi et al. 2017). Early works by Hartzell et al. (2001) and Hartzell and Hoddie (2003) emphasized the role of security concerns for warring parties in peace agreements and stressed that the ability to deliver on security concerns is crucial for understanding the success of peace agreements. The legitimacy of such security concerns can be bolstered through extensive power-sharing agreements monitored by third-party guarantors. Succeeding works have also lent support to this notion, finding that power-sharing agreements have a pacifying effects in post-conflict societies (Joshi and Mason 2011). Although, even the pacifying effects of power-sharing agreements should be viewed with an asterisk as demonstrated by DeRouen et al. (2009) who found that power-sharing agreements that were costlier to the government are more likely to break down.
